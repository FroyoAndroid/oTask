# Contribute as a non-technical team member

Our first few users who motivated us to carry on the work for oTask was our closest family members and friends. Most of who wansn't technical at all, yet they made a huge impact. If you want to help out in some way grea, please give us a call. Even if you just want to say hello that motivates us. 

We always need non technical team members who can give us a new perspective on things. If you want to get involved but don't have any perticular tech skill, don't worry just give us a call and we'll find someway to intigrat you to oTask productivity family :)
