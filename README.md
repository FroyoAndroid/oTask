# oTask: Readme
*Last Updated: 29 Nov 2015*

**oTask** is a simple task management system. It is not just an ordinary task management system. **oTask** is a peaceful task management phylosophy. The goal of **oTask** is to help you start with a blank slate everyday and finish with zero task left on your list. 

The name **oTask** is short for ***Zero Task***. 

**oTask** borrows from Agile software development phylosophy and supercharges your daily task management system. At **oTask** you see your day as a sprint and try to do what is possible. Anything you can't do today gets removed and the next day you start again from a blank task list. Unlike treditional task management systems you can't save your tasks. In the morning or at the start of your work day you open **oTask** and write down as much as you can remember and want to do that day. You can bring in tasks from other task list to **oTask** at the beginning of the day.

The idea is if something is important enough you will remember it. Also the process of writing a task at the beginning of the work day gets your brain into grear for that task. 

**oTask** is opensource and have no copywright on it. Feel free to contribute, update and and use for your own needs. If you've made some major improvemens we would love to see it so please let us know with pull requests. 

More to be continued . . .

Hope you enjoy it **oTask**.
