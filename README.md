# oTask
[The Simplest ToDo List](http://bappygolder.github.io/oTask/) - A Peaceful Task Management Philosophy <br/> 
*ReadMe Last Updated: 29 Nov 2015*

##About
**oTask** is a simple ToDo List (task management system). It is not just an ordinary todo list. **oTask** is what we call a peaceful task management philosophy. The goal of **oTask** is to help you start with a blank slate everyday and finish with zero task left on your list. 

The name **oTask** is short for ***Zero Task***. 

##How It Works
**oTask** borrows from Agile software development philosophy and supercharges your daily task management system. At **oTask** you see your day as a sprint and try to do what is possible on that day. Anything you can't do today gets removed and the next day you start again from a blank task list. Unlike traditional task management systems you can't save your tasks. In the morning or at the start of your work day you open **oTask** and write down as much as you can remember and want to do that day. You can bring in tasks from other task list to **oTask** at the beginning of each day.

The idea is if something is important enough you will remember it. Also the process of writing a task at the beginning of the work day gets your brain into gear for that task. You can use **oTask** along with other task management systems to get things done faster and more efficiently.
